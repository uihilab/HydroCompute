## Web Assembly Engine
### Introduction
This engine calla methods and functions compliant with code compiled into Web Assembly. 

### Set Up
Upon initialization of the HydroCompute instance, call the engine as:
```javascript
const compute = new hydrocompute("wasm");
``` 
Or if the instance already has a different engine, change it as:
```javascript
compute.setEngine("wasm");
```
Once changed, all the methods and scripts found in the scripts folder will be ready for usage.
